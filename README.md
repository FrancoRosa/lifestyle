# LifeStyle-Hack

> This is an article demo page using Hackaday contents a sample.

[Hackaday](hackaday.com) is my daily reading so I enjoy to create a version of its web page using this [design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14554909/liFEsTlye-Mobile-version).

I liked to build this project while reading hackaday posts, for this project I used Ruby on Rails as the backend and plain and HTML CSS on the frontend.

Postgres is the production database while all images are stored on [GoogleCould](https://cloud.google.com)

To make GCS work with rails I followed this [guide](https://medium.com/@pjbelo/setting-up-rails-5-2-active-storage-using-google-cloud-storage-and-heroku-23df91e830f8):

## Live Demo
I will feel honored if you try my app and tell me how to improve it.
it is hosted on a Heroku Free account so be patience, sometimes it takes a while to load.
